How to use:

· Open vATIS
· Import > \LIXX\Plugins\vATIS - All the files [LIMM, LIRR, LIBB]
· Remember to change the ARPT COND by pressing on the text "ARPT COND"
· It'll open a new popup and then choose the Runway Condition Report - here you can choose between code 6 (dry) and code 5 (wet). For apts with LVPs active the rwy CC **must not** be used since it is already included in
the LVP profile. You can set the RVR for TDZ, MID and END parts of RWY (just replace the "-" with a numerical value).
. If you wish you can change the NOTAMS by pressing on the text "NOTAMS"
. It'll open a new popup and then choose from different standard APT INFO or OP INFO with the possibility of adding your own (i.e. TWY/RWY closures...)
· That's it!
